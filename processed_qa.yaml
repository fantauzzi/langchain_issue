    One year later, retired United States special operative Nicolas Shaw lives a quiet
    life in hiding. In flashbacks, Shaw partially remembers being tortured by an unknown
    perpetrator who forced him to give out the names of his colleagues, who were shot
    by the assailant, before being framed for the assassinations. After being confronted
    by a member of the agency he was once a part of, Shaw meets with Elias Kane, his
    former boss, who tells him that his daughter, Monica, has been kidnapped by a
    perpetrator named Quinton.


    While investigating, Shaw manages to rescue Monica after escaping a shootout with
    the guards. However, Shaw is soon held at gunpoint by Monica, who reveals she
    and her father were trying to capture Shaw to retrieve encrypted information.
    After taking away her firearm, Shaw takes Monica into a forest, where it is revealed
    that she has been shot. At a house, Shaw tells Monica that Quinton was the unknown
    perpetrator who made him give out the identities of his colleagues by drugging
    him; Monica tells Shaw that, in fact, he gave out the names before he was tortured
    and that the drug caused him to forget the events. Soon after, Monica escapes
    and reunites with her father, where the pair learn Shaw erased the encrypted information.

    the information. Meanwhile, Kane begins to track Shaw by visiting the diner and
    bookstore Shaw frequently visited, where he meets Janice, the waitress Shaw flirted
    with, and shoots the bookstore owner who knows about Shaw''s true identity. After
    decoding the information, Shaw learns it was Kane who tortured him, drugging him
    to forget his memories but failing to retrieve Quinton''s information.

    intentions. Finding Janice in Kane''s car, Shaw begins to track down Kane. In
    a shootout, the pair are led to a pier, where Monica arrives, having learned that
    Kane was the one who caused the death of her lover Javier, and Shaw shoots and
    kills Kane before Monica does.

    colleagues. As she reveals that she knew about Kane''s plan all along, the pair
    discuss the possibility of a larger conspiracy before Shaw pulls out a gun. Outside,

    will leave town for a "few business days".'
